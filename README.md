This project , as the name suggests (Order flow visualizer) , is tool I made to help visualize different types of trading data , mainly orderbook and Time&Sales
I have shown the different data through bar graphs in the "Graphs" section, if you prefer numbers you can just see the raw data in the "Ladder" section. 

The Graph section contains of two graphs for the two data (OrderBook and Time&Sales);
Active buyers/sellers -> Time&Sales data visualized , 
Passive buyers/sellers -> OrderBook data visualized.

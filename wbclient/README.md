C++ Backend (wbclient folder)

The C++ folder is included to show that the project can scale to a high-performance backend if needed. 
For now, the backend is implemented in TypeScript with uWebSockets.js to allow faster development, 
easier frontend integration, and simpler deployment. 
The C++ setup remains ready for future optimization if ultra-low latency becomes necessary.
